"""
Perplexity Web Reasoning Example - Python Client
================================================

This script demonstrates how to use Perplexity's reasoning models with web access.
These models can search the web in real-time and provide citations for their answers,
making them perfect for current events, research, and fact-checking.

NOTE: Your AI account must have web access models enabled.

For complete API documentation see postman.md
For standard models see example.py
